# Getting Started

>**Note**: You need to have NodeJS installed, NPM, Android Stuido + Build Tools, and an Android Virtual Device created using Android API 35 (Other API versions were not tested

## Step 1: Clone the application
```bash
git clone <repo>
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
# using npm
npm install
```

## Step 3: Start your Android Virtual Device using Android Studio
Ensure your Android Virtual Device is running, or your Android Device is plugged with USB Debugging enabled

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-android
```

### For iOS - Note the application was not tested for iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
